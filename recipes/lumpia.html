                <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Instructions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Place a wok or large skillet over high heat, and pour in 1 tablespoon vegetable oil. Cook pork,
                        stirring frequently,<br>
                        until no pink is showing. Remove pork from pan and set aside. Drain grease from pan, leaving a
                        thin coating. Cook garlic<br>
                        and onion in the same pan for 2 minutes. Stir in the cooked pork, carrots, green onions, and
                        cabbage. Season with<br>
                        pepper, salt, garlic powder, and soy sauce. Remove from heat, and set aside until cool enough to
                        handle.<br>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Place three heaping tablespoons of the filling diagonally near one corner of each wrapper,
                        leaving a 1 1/2 inch space at<br>
                        both ends. Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both ends,
                        and roll neatly. Keep the<br>
                        roll tight as you assemble. Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge.
                        Cover the rolls with<br>
                        plastic wrap to retain moisture.<br>

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat, add oil to 1/2 inch depth, and heat for 5 minutes. Slide
                        3 or 4 lumpia into the<br>
                        oil. Fry the rolls for 1 to 2 minutes, until all sides are golden brown. Drain on paper towels.
                        Serve immediately.<br>
